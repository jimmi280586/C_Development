this is an explanation on our structure in this program
we have desided to use linked structure because we found this easyer with c programing
our database consist of pointers pointing to difrent nodes(pointers) in our memory
we then use difrent structures for controlling these pointers for eksample we use a structure like enviroment 
like teacher, student and assignment these are of similar structure we can think of them as object using jave terminology
but they are called structure or type in c

we use a file for storing the information of teachers and students this gave us som problems 
that we were not compleatly able to solve it gives us an error midt print se atached picture
we have no idea why this error is givven and would apreciate if you might give an explanation as to why

another thin we found difficult were keeping track of the memory this gave a chalange to us but i think we found 
the solution looking throu your slides and getting som inspiration from stack overflow

we have learned much doing this assignment about c programing and look forward to nex semester wher we will do more
hands on programming.

we were not expecting to do the uml and we think it is wrong but give some feedback on this aswell.
